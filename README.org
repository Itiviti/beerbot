* A beer bot for Slack
Based on original idea from Mihai Oltean. 
Lets one offer and receive virtual beers on slack messageing system.
Also features a "beerboard" with stats.

* To run 
- clone the repo
- create a bot token using slack
- add an init.edn in conf folder containing
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  {
   :slack-bot-auth-token ""
   :proxy-host ""
   :proxy-port 
   }
#+END_SRC
- start a repl
- run following to create persistence file (to be done only first time)
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (nwrite! {:beers ()})

#+END_SRC
- run 
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (start)
#+END_SRC

* Disclaimer
It's a very quick and dirty implementation which is likely to be never refactored or changed. It does mot respect any coding standards and 
its persistence is not transactional. Use at your own risk ;)
